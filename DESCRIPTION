Title: A Simple R Package for Classical Parametric Statistical Tests
        and Confidence Intervals in Large Samples
Author: Cqls Team
Maintainer: Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux <lafaye@unsw.edu.au>
Depends: R (>= 1.8.0)
Description: One and two sample mean and variance
 tests (differences and ratios) are considered.
 The test statistics are all expressed in the same
 form as the Student t-test, which facilitates their
 presentation in the classroom. This contribution
 also fills the gap of a robust (to non-normality)
 alternative to the chi-square single variance test
 for large samples, since no such procedure is implemented
 in standard statistical software.
